# OXID Console

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/EllisV/oxid-console.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/EllisV/oxid-console)

OXID Console is php console application for OXID Shop. It provides an API for writting various commands.

By default there are following commands included:

* `cache:clear` - Clear OXID cache from tmp folder
* `db:update` - Updates database views
* `fix:states` - Fixes modules metadata states
* `g:migration` - Generate new migration file
* `g:module` - Generate new module scaffold
* `list` - *(default)* List of all available commands
* `migrate` - Run migration scripts

This OXID Console repository has **Migration Handler** and **Module State Fixer** included.

## Installation

This package is following a structure which OXID introduced with their update packages.
* Copy contents of `copy_this` to your OXID eShop project
* Check the difference between your OXID eShop files and files which are in `changed_full` and update files according to the difference

## Getting started

The entry point of console application is `php oxid`. It will execute default command which is `list`. To call a specific command run `php oxid [command]`. If you need help about specific command run `php oxid [command] -h` or `php oxid [command] --help`

## Defining your own command

* Commands get autoloaded from `application/commands/` and `[module_path]/commands/` directories. But you can always add or remove commands with `add()` or `remove()` methods of console application
* You can access console application `$this->getConsoleApplication()` and input object `$this->getInput()` in your command class
* Command filename must follow `[your_command]command.php` format
* Class name must be the same as filename, e.g. CacheClearCommand
* Class must extend oxConsoleCommand abstract class
* You must set name of your command on configure() method

### Template for your command:

```php
<?php

/**
 * My own command
 *
 * Demo command for learning
 */
class MyOwnCommand extends oxConsoleCommand
{

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function configure()
    {
        $this->setName('my:own');
        $this->setDescription('Demo command for learning');
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function help(oxIOutput $oOutput)
    {
        $oOutput->writeLn('This is my help output');
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function execute(oxIOutput $oOutput)
    {
        $oInput = $this->getInput();
        $oInput->hasOption(array('demo', 'd')) {
            $oOutput->writeLn('You typed in --demo or -d also');
        }

        $oOutput->writeLn('My demo command finished');
    }
}
```

## Working with arguments and options

First of all You must know that `-abc` is the same as `-a -b -c` and it is a good practice to have long version of option too, e.g. `-a` is the same as `--all`.
Console Input provides you with various methods to work with options. There is nothing better than a good example:

### Command class

```php
<?php

/**
 * My own command
 *
 * Demo command for learning
 */
class MyOwnCommand extends oxConsoleCommand
{

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function configure()
    {
        $this->setName('my:own');
        $this->setDescription('Demo command for learning');
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function help(oxIOutput $oOutput)
    {
        // TODO: Implement help() method
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function execute(oxIOutput $oOutput)
    {
        $oInput = $this->getInput();

        var_dump($oInput->hasOption(array('a', 'all')));
        var_dump($oInput->hasOption('b'));
        var_dump($oInput->hasOption('not-valid'));

        var_dump($oInput->getOption('word'));

        var_dump($oInput->getOptions());
        var_dump($oInput->getArguments());

        var_dump($oInput->getArgument(2));
    }
}
```

### php oxid my:own -o cat --all tree -bzg house --word=nice dog

```
bool(true)
bool(true)
bool(false)

string(4) "nice"

array(6) {
  'o'    => bool(true)
  'all'  => bool(true)
  'b'    => bool(true)
  'z'    => bool(true)
  'g'    => bool(true)
  'word' => string(4) "nice"
}
array(5) {
  [0] => string(6) "my:own"
  [1] => string(3) "cat"
  [2] => string(4) "tree"
  [3] => string(5) "house"
  [4] => string(3) "dog"
}

string(4) "tree"
```

## Migrations

OXID Console project includes migration handling. Lets generate sample migration by running `php oxid g:migration add amount field to demo module`.

Console application generated `migration/20140312161434_addamountfieldtodemomodule.php` file with its contents:

```php
<?php

class AddAmountFieldToDemoModuleMigration extends oxMigrationQuery
{

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function up()
    {
        // TODO: Implement up() method.
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function down()
    {
        // TODO: Implement down() method.
    }
}
```

Migration handler can run migrations with your given timestamp *(if no timestamp provided than it assumes timestamp as current timestamp)*. Inside it saves which migration queries were executed and knows which migration queries go up or go down.

Once we generated this file we run `php oxid migrate`

```
Running migration scripts
[DEBUG] Migrating up 20140312161434 addamountfieldtodemomodulemigration
Migration finished successfully
```

Now lets run the same command a second time

```
Running migration scripts
Migration finished successfully
```

*Note: No migration scripts were ran*

Ok, now lets run migrations with given timestamp of the past with `php oxid migrate 2013-01-01` command

```
Running migration scripts
[DEBUG] Migrating down 20140312161434 addamountfieldtodemomodulemigration
Migration finished successfully
```

It ran our migration query down because on given timestamp we should not have had executed that migration query.

### Example

Here is a quick example of migration query which adds a column to oxuser table

```php
<?php
// FILE: 20140414085723_adddemoculumntooxuser.php

class AddDemoCulumnToOxUserMigration extends oxMigrationQuery
{

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function up()
    {
        if ($this->_columnExists('oxuser', 'OXDEMO')) {
            return;
        }

        $sSql = "ALTER TABLE  `oxuser`
                 ADD  `OXDEMO`
                    CHAR( 32 )
                    CHARACTER SET utf8
                    COLLATE utf8_general_ci
                    NULL
                    DEFAULT NULL
                    COMMENT  'Demo field for migration'";

        oxDb::getDb()->execute($sSql);
    }

    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    public function down()
    {
        if (!$this->_columnExists('oxuser', 'OXDEMO')) {
            return;
        }

        oxDb::getDb()->execute('ALTER TABLE `oxuser` DROP `OXDEMO`');
    }
}
```

### Migration Query Law

* Filename must follow `YYYYMMDDHHiiss_description.php` format
* Must extend oxMigrationQuery abstract class
* Class name must be the same as description with *Migration* word appended to the end of the name

*Note: It is better to use generator for migration queries creation*

## Module state fixer

### Current problem

When you change information of module in metadata you need to reactivate the module for changes to take effect. It is a bad idea for live systems because you might loose data and it bugs out developers to do this all the time by hand.

### Solution

oxModuleStateFixer which is an extension of oxModuleInstaller has method `fix()` which will fix all the states.

We have provided you with `fix:states` command to work with oxModuleStateFixer. Type in `php oxid fix:states --help` for more information.
